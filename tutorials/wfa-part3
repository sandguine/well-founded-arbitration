🏆 CONGRATULATIONS! 

You have now:
✅ Independently discovered the core concepts
✅ Built intuition through hands-on experimentation  
✅ Connected your discoveries to the formal framework
✅ Implemented a practical version

KEY INSIGHTS YOU'VE GAINED:

1️⃣ EPISTEMIC ARBITRATION: The fundamental challenge of acting under 
   internal disagreement

2️⃣ DUAL CONDITIONS: Both sufficiency (preserving distinctions) and 
   stability (robust aggregation) are necessary

3️⃣ ABSTENTION AS VIRTUE: Sometimes not acting preserves future options
   for principled coordination

4️⃣ COMPUTATIONAL TRACTABILITY: Real implementations need sampling-based
   approximations and careful parameter tuning

5️⃣ SCALE INVARIANCE: The framework applies from neural modules to 
   human-AI teams to democratic institutions

🤔 FINAL REFLECTION QUESTIONS:

What aspects of the paper make more sense now that you've built the intuition?

How might this framework apply to your own decision-making?

What extensions or applications can you imagine?

What questions do you still have about the formal mathematical treatment?

📚 Ready to dive deeper into the paper? You now have the conceptual foundation
to understand the advanced topics like Strategic Equivalence Relations,
modal logic connections, and the complexity analysis!
